	<h1>Fall Ball (WEBSITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION)</h1>
        <p>Fall is a time for players to sharpen their skills while having some fun. 
            It's a good time to meet the players if you are new and interested in playing 
            as well.  There are try outs, though if you missed a deadline or two we welcome you
            to contact us or stop by a practice to let us know so that we can make it work out.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Spring Ball</h2>
        <p>Spring season starts with a week of try outs and is more serious than fall ball.  
            There are games almost every other weekend and mandatory practices in order play 
         in these games. We've gone on many fun road trips in the past including Maryland,
        Montreal, Boston and Rhode Island.</p>
